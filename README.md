**APPENDIX D: OBSERVATIONAL STUDY CONDUCTED AT SYSLAB SDN BHD (S4)

This appendix contains the data collected in input form and a case study of Riding Pink, an E-Hailing Project which is analyzed based on observation data obtained about DM and BP tasks at Syslab Sdn Bhd. The information is further structured into broad categories and sub-categories according to the data collected.

This is the second type of study that is a very active participant observational study which is conducted on small and medium enterprises SMEs. The obtained data is then analyzed to identify concepts related to the bug-handling process for prioritization tasks, labelled using the concept-driven generic model, and then collected in data input forms. Various memos are created for the categorization process. This study is conducted on three main projects which include Gaja, Suara and Riding Pink, however, on small study is conducted on the Eden project.

**APPENDIX E: OTHERS (DATA COLLECTION AND VALIDATION) (S5-S9)

**A. Identification of DM Concepts from Studies on DM (Chapter 2)

In Chapter 2, section 4.2, various factors are identified from different studies conducted on DMP and DMF.           illustrates the factors and describes their impact on DM. The first column illustrates the main categories whereas the second column describes a summary of these factors that are classified under the main category, their impact on DM, and the design of DMF. Error! Reference source not found.2 illustrates the categorization process in which main categories and sub-categories are identified. 

The below URLs contain archival data from Table E.1 and Table E.2 that illustrate the factors impacting DM identified from the literature
